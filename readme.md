Step1:
run the src/run_term_encoding_module.py to get the feature vector representation of GO terms, which are saved in the term_encoding_output/*.emb.

Step2: run

Step3:
(1) run run_ppi_exp.py to test the model using PPI datasets

(2) run run_expression_exp.py to test the model using expression datasets

(3) run run_sequence_exp.py to test the model using sequence datasets
